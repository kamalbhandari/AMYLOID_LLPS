We have developed a new kinetics model for amyloid aggregation which considers the liquid-liquid phase separation of homogeneous protein solution as a result of which gives two heterogeneous protein phase. Fibril nucleation and growth occur out of both protein heterogeneous phases: Droplet phase ( Protein rich dense phase) and Solution phase (Protein poor dilute phase).
