# Introduction
Protein aggregation into amyloid fibrils is a hallmark of numerous neurodegenerative diseases and systematic diseases. Many amyloid protein undergo liquid-liquid phase separation, forming protein-rich condensates before fibrilization. However, the role of LLPS in modulation amyloid aggregation remains unclear due to conflicting reports of promotion, inhibition, and biphasic effects.

In this project, we develop an integrated thermodynamics-kinetics model that incorporates LLPS-induced heterogeneity to analyze amyloid aggregation pathways. The model captures the time evolution of monomers, droplets, oligomers, and fibrils under varying conditions, including the presence of salt. Using this framework, we systematically investigate how key parameters affect aggregation kinetics and provide insights into the complex interplay betyween LLPS and amyloid fibril formation.
